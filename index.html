        <p>I am a world traveler, well I've been a few places, not actually the worldüòÅHowever, I have many many more to visit!</p>
        <p>So far within the US, I've been to 29 - 31 different cities and states. I know that's not much.üòû</p>
        <p>Again though, I have so much more space to color in on this life's experience.</p>
        <p>I've been out of the country 7 total times, with Mexico being my most visited country as of now. I love the Latin American countries.</p>
        <p>Here's a couple of pics of me in Sao Paulo, Brazil:</p>

        <p>The last pic isn't of anything special. It's just me.</p>
        <p>While it's just a pic of me, I am in another state, Minnesota. I couldn't find the one of me in a foot of snow.</p>
        <p>Anyhow, it was a cool time, and this is me signing out in my "Hey Look Ma I made it stance"! </p>
